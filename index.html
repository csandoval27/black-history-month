  <div class = "main">
    Born in Columbus, Ohio, on April 23, 1856, Woods received little schooling as a young man and, in his early teens, took up a variety of jobs, including as a railroad engineer in a railroad machine shop, as an engineer on a British ship, in a steel mill, and as a railroad worker. From 1876 to 1878, Woods lived in New York City, taking courses in engineering and electricity — a subject that he realized, early on, held the key to the future. Back in Ohio in the summer of 1878, Woods was employed for eight months by the Springfield, Jackson and Pomeroy Railroad Company to work at the pumping stations and the shifting of cars in the city of Washington Court House, Ohio. He was then employed by the Dayton and Southeastern Railway Company as an engineer for 13 months. During this period, while traveling between Washington Court House and Dayton, Woods began to form ideas for what would later be credited as his most important invention: the "inductor telegraph." He worked in the area until the spring of 1880 and then moved to Cincinnati.
    <br><br>
    Living in Cincinnati, Woods eventually set up his own company to develop, manufacture and sell electrical apparatus, and in 1889, he filed his first patent for an improved steam boiler furnace. His later patents were mainly for electrical devices, including his second invention, an improved telephone transmitter.The patent for his device, which combined the telephone and telegraph, was bought by Alexander Graham Bell, and the payment freed Woods to devote himself to his own research. One of his most important inventions was the "troller," a grooved metal wheel that allowed street cars (later known as "trolleys") to collect electric power from overhead wires.

    Woods's most important invention was the multiplex telegraph, also known as the "induction telegraph," or block system, in 1887. The device allowed men to communicate by voice over telegraph wires, ultimately helping to speed up important communications and, subsequently, preventing crucial errors such as train accidents. Woods defeated Edison's lawsuit that challenged his patent, and turned down Edison's offer to make him a partner. Thereafter, Woods was often known as "Black Edison." By the time of his death, on January 30, 1910, in New York City, Woods had invented 15 appliances for electric railways. received nearly 60 patents, many of which were assigned to the major manufacturers of electrical equipment that are a part of today's daily life.

Woods and his life of invention, Head is now spearheading a major effort to increase the participation of urban youth in the fields of science and technology. By integrating field trips and practical experience with his S.T.E.M. program classroom curriculum, youth will be motivated and guided in an innovative approach to contemporary challenges. With this goal in mind, careers in science and technology will be encouraged and given direction.</div>

This book is not intended to dispute, dishonor, or argue for or against a particular accomplishment by Granville Taylor Woods. Rather, the author aims to furnish a concise way to present the material in laymans terms. To put something in laymans terms is to describe a complex or technical issue using words and terms that an average individual may comprehend the basic concept.</div>

      <br> Describing how Woods, Latimer, and Davidson struggled to balance their complicated racial identities―as both black and white communities perceived them―with their hopes of being judged solely on the content of their inventive work, Fouché provides a nuanced view of African American contributions to―and relationships with―technology during a period of rapid industrialization and mounting national attention to the inequities of a separate-but-equal social order.
